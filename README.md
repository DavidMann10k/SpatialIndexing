# SpatialIndexing

Simple spatial indexing for whatever purpose. If you find this useful for any reason I'd love to hear about it.

## Octree

This implementatino is designed to hold a list of abitrary objects on each node. Simply declare an Octree and start adding position-value pairs and the octree automatically handles the rest.

Querying of this spatial index is forthcoming.
